CUCM JABBER DIALER PORTAL
=====================================
Allowing Access to Telehealth using Cisco Collab

CUCM Jabber Dialer Portal is a project that was being worked with a medical equipment manufacturer as an integration solution using Cisco Collaboration Solutions. 
This was developed to address the following:  
**Need:** Ability for Intensivist to monitor and interact with ICU remotely and provide diagnosis  
**Challenge:** Calling into the existing video equipment is not intuitive and is not integrated to their eICU portal  
**Future Enhancements**: This is not limited to just Telehealth but can be used for multiple other cases as needed.
